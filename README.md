# Introduction
`RbLogger` is a modern logger implementation for Ruby application.

# Motivation
The standard Ruby `Logger` class has a huge and complex interface and does not
provides features like formatting, metadata, etc. I built this library to have
simple logger with modern features, simple interface to write production
application.

# Documentation
The [handbook](doc/handbook.md) contains information about various aspects of
the library.

You can also use the [yard](https://yardoc.org) documentation tool to read
code documentation, for example:
